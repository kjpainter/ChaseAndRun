This repository contains the necessary Matlab files to simulate the 1D Chase-And-Run model described in Painter, Giunta, Potts and Bernardi. 

To run the code, run the file "runChaseAndRun1D.m" from Matlab. The resulting simulation will simulate a basic chase-and-run dynamic, such the two populations self-organise into a cluster of chasers chasing a cluster of runners. Changing system parameters will generate different dynamics, see the paper for details.

Please note that the code relies on the numerical method and code first developed by Alf Gerisch. Use of this code should therefore refer to and cite the following article:
